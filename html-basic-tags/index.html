            If you wish to use a component of a reversed tag (or the whole tag)
            you would be in trouble using the tag. 
            instead: you can special character springs to represent components of the tag such as the < (&lt;)
            and the > (&gt;) symbols

        <h3>Anchor tag (aka linking to another page)</h3>
        <!-- Blocked paired
            This is an anchor tag and is incorrectly often referred to as the 
            link tag
            One should not use the link tag because there is actually a <link> 
            The anchor tag can take you to a different location whether it be on a different website, 
                    different page in the current website or a different location on the current 
                    page. 

            parameters:
            href: points to the desired location
            target: indicates the browser page display option
                    default is the same display page tab 
                    _blank will open a new browser tab (page)
